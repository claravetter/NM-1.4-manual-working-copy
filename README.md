# NeuroMiner 1.3 Manual

This is just a **private** repository to backup the manual website markdown files. The website is hosted from the *neurominer/NeuroMiner_1.3* repository but I removed the ./docs/ folder from the main branch of the repository since users don't need these files when they download the software. 

If people want to contribute to the manual, this organization makes it easier as they can just push changes to the markdown files to this repository here and they don't need to build the html files themselves.
